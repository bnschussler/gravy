A (not very good) simulation of how galaxies form. I wanted to test out embedding processing documents in HTML, and it was a nightmare because processing acts differently on its application and on the web, and because of some JS security protocol, I couldn't iterate this on my local computer. It makes everything a pain to iterate and bug fix, which is why there are 100+ commits to this repo, as well as why I never plan on doing something like it again.

Eventually, I caved and translated all the Processing into JS, which was much nicer to work with. I managed to add in functionality for any (positive real) number of dimesnions, which looks very cool. I might come back to this to make the rotations a bit better (i.e. using matricies instead fo gimbals).
